In our domain model, a user opens a chat session and asks one or more questions in natural language. For each question, the system generates an answer connected to the appropriate business data source. To ensure transparency, each answer may include the generated SQL query, the resulting dataset, and optional visualizations such as charts and a brief summary. To improve performance over time, the system maintains reusable knowledge through a cache for exact repeated questions and vector embeddings for semantically similar queries. The model also supports continuous improvement and accountability. Administrators can upload training documents to enhance domain understanding, users can provide feedback by approving or disapproving answers, and audit events are recorded to monitor system usage, performance, and errors.
